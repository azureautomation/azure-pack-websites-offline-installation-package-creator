Azure Pack Websites Offline Installation Package Creator
========================================================

            

This script uses a local installation of WAP Websites to create an Offline installation package. This can be particularly useful if you need to re-install WAP Websites or add it to an installation at a later date.


You will need to run this as the same user that has WAP Websites installed as it tries to find the Websites.exe file in the Local App Data of the user to create the offline installation media.


 

 

 


 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
